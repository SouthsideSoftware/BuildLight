          <p>Framework for connecting a build server status to a build light/lamp, audible notification and other sorts of things like mobile alerts.  Right now it only supports TeamCity and a red/green/blue LED light made by Delcom that connects to the USB port and is supported on Mac, Windows and Linux.  See below for more information.</p>

<p>Pretty soon you will be able to create your own plugins to provide other sorts of notification.</p>

<p>We will probably also add support for CruiseControl.Net and Jenkins.</p>
