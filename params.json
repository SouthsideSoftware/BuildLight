Right now it only supports TeamCity and a red/green/blue LED light made by Delcom that connects to the USB port and is supported on Mac, Windows and Linux.  See below for more information.\r\n\r\nPretty soon you will be able to create your own plugins to provide other sorts of notification.\r\n\r\nWe will probably also add support for CruiseControl.Net and Jenkins.\r\n\r\n##Contact Us\r\n\r\nSee our [Trello Board](https://trello.com/board/build-light/504b4a2e72e2d9db2e3ede6e) to see what we have in the pipeline.

It will indicate status as follows:\r\n\r\n* Off when it cannot reach the configured TeamCity server or some other error has occured\r\n* Flashing blue when any configuration is building on the server\r\n* Flashing red when no configuration is building and at least one configuration's most recent build has failed\r\n* Green when no configuration is building and all configuration's most recent builds have succeeeded\r\n\r\n##License\r\n\r\nThe application and source code are licensed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT):\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Southside Software, LLC\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
